# Applications of Machine Learning in Remote Sensing Projects Repository

This repository contains code for various machine learning and remote sensing projects

## Running code
All code should be run from the top level of the project. For example, to run the `plot_bands` function, from the project root, run the line:
```commandline
python eda/plot_bands.py
```
